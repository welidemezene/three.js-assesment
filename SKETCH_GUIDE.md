# Sketching & Extrusion Guide

## How to Use Sketching Mode

### Step 1: Enter Sketch Mode
1. Click the **"Enter Sketch"** button in the left panel
2. The button will turn red and show "Exit Sketch" when active

### Step 2: Choose a Sketch Tool
Select one of three tools:
- **Rectangle**: For rectangular shapes
- **Circle**: For circular shapes  
- **Polygon**: For custom shapes with multiple points

### Step 3: Draw Your Sketch

#### Rectangle Tool:
1. Click on the grid to set the first corner
2. Drag your mouse to the opposite corner
3. Release to finish
4. You'll see a green preview while drawing

#### Circle Tool:
1. Click on the grid to set the center point
2. Drag your mouse to set the radius
3. Release to finish
4. You'll see a green preview while drawing

#### Polygon Tool:
1. Click multiple points on the grid
2. Watch the "Points" counter increase
3. Click near the first point to close the polygon
4. Need at least 3 points to close
5. You'll see green lines connecting the points

### Step 4: Exit Sketch Mode
- Click **"Exit Sketch"** button when done drawing
- Your sketches will be saved and appear in the "Extrude Sketches" section

## How to Extrude Sketches

### Step 1: View Your Sketches
- After exiting sketch mode, you'll see a section called **"Extrude Sketches"**
- Each sketch will be listed with its type (rectangle, circle, or polygon)

### Step 2: Extrude a Sketch
1. Find the sketch you want to extrude in the list
2. Click the **"Extrude"** button next to it
3. The sketch will be converted to a 3D object (orange color)
4. The object appears at the height of the sketch

### Step 3: Use the Extruded Object
- The extruded object behaves like any other 3D object
- You can select it by clicking
- You can transform it using the Properties panel
- You can move, rotate, and scale it

## Tips for Better Sketches

1. **Grid Snapping**: All sketches snap to the grid automatically
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with rectangles before trying polygons
3. **Plan Your Design**: Think about what shape you want before extruding
4. **Multiple Sketches**: You can create multiple sketches before extruding
5. **Experiment**: Try different shapes and combinations

## Example Workflow

1. **Create 3D Objects**: Click Box/Sphere/Cylinder buttons
2. **Enter Sketch Mode**: Click "Enter Sketch"
3. **Choose Rectangle Tool**: Click the Rectangle button
4. **Draw a Rectangle**: Click and drag on the grid
5. **Exit Sketch Mode**: Click "Exit Sketch"
6. **Extrude**: Click "Extrude" button next to your sketch
7. **Transform**: Select and move the extruded object

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't see sketches**: Make sure you're in Sketch Mode
- **Extrude button not showing**: You need to exit Sketch Mode first
- **Polygon won't close**: Click closer to the first point
- **Sketch too small**: Try drawing larger shapes on the grid

## What Gets Extruded?

- **Rectangle**: Becomes a rectangular box
- **Circle**: Becomes a cylinder
- **Polygon**: Becomes a custom extruded shape

All extruded objects are orange-colored and can be selected and transformed like other 3D objects!
